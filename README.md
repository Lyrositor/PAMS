PAMS
====

*Bubble Collision Simulator 2015 Ltd. Edition 2.0*

**PAMS** represents the cutting edge of bubble to bubble and bubble to wall
collision simulation. Every collision generates a single note; combined with a
great number of collisions, every simulation can result in an unusual melodious
combination finely-tuned to provoke powerful feelings within the listener.

PAMS was created in 2015 by Perrine Bard, Anne Geraudon, Marc Gagn√© and Soline
Gautier.
